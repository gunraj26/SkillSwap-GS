## Inspiration
Ever found yourself wanting to learn a new skill but hesitating to pay for classes? Or perhaps you have a skill you're passionate about sharing but lack a platform to connect with learners? SkillSwap was inspired by the idea of creating a community-driven exchange where people can teach and learn without monetary barriers. It’s about empowering individuals to grow through collaboration, not competition.

## What it does
SkillSwap is a platform that connects people with complementary skills. Users can list skills they want to learn and those they can teach, creating a dynamic marketplace of learning. By facilitating skill exchanges, the platform fosters personal growth, meaningful connections, and a sense of community among its users.

## How we built it
We developed SkillSwap using React for the frontend and JavaScript Supabase as our backend database and authentication service. The application features dynamic user profiles, skill listing, search and filtering capabilities, and a matching algorithm to suggest potential connections. The design prioritizes simplicity and usability, ensuring an intuitive experience for all users.

## Challenges we ran into
Building SkillSwap presented challenges such as:
> Developing an intuitive UI that balances functionality with aesthetic appeal.
> Testing the matching algorithm to ensure it connects users with relevant skill exchanges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
> Successfully creating a platform that bridges the gap between learners and teachers.
> Designing an engaging, user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience.
> Building a robust backend system that ensures fast and reliable performance.

## What we learned
> Building a full-stack application and integrating third-party services like Supabase.
> Handling real-world challenges like scalability, user authentication, and data security.
> The importance of user-centric design in creating impactful solutions.
> Collaboration and problem-solving in a team-driven development environment.

## What's next for Skill Swap
The journey doesn’t end here! Future plans for SkillSwap include:
> Implementing advanced matching algorithms based on skill level, location, and user preferences.
> Adding features like group skill exchanges, live video sessions, and ratings/reviews for users.
